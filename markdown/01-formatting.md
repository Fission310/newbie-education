# Markdown Formatting

## GitHub-Flavored Markdown

Unfortunately, there isn't a uniform set of rules governing formatting for markdown, so different versions of these rules, or "flavors", exist. However, this lesson will focus on GitHub-flavored markdown, which is used by GitHub to render README and other markdown files in HTML. Without further ado...

## Creating Your Own Markdown

### Rendering
If you have already taken the Git course, then you can commit and push your practice Markdown files to GitHub to render the markdown as HTML. However, this is not required; you can use a live markdown preview website ([like this!](http://markdownlivepreview.com/)) to render the markdown.

### Formatting
Below is a table with the markdown equivalents of common HTML elements:

| Element type | HTML element | Markdown equivalent | Example  |
| Header       | `<h1></h1>`  | `#`                 | # header |
|              |              |                     |          |

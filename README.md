# newbie-education
This repo contains lessons and/or lesson plans for Stuy Fission Newbie Education. The lessons mainly pertain to Software Engineering, but team members in other departments may find the contained material helpful. It is suggested that the Head of Software Engineering be familiar with the lessons, and for every new software engineering or electronics member to go through the lessons.

These lessons should __not__ replace hands-on learning. They should be supplements to the design and build process of a robot, and introduced throughout the season as appropriate.

This project was started by Ryan Siu in February 2018 with the intent of preserving knowledge and learned experience for future generations of the team.

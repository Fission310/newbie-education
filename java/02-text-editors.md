# Text Editors

## How do we Program and Code?

Code can be written in either a __text editor__ or an __IDE__ (integrated development environment).

### Text Editors
- Requires terminal to compile/execute code
- Can be used for any programming language or __plaintext__ files
- Examples include Emacs, Sublime, Atom, gedit, and Vim

### IDEs
- Can compile and run code
- Usually used for a specific programming language/set of languages
- Examples include Android Studio (what we use; Java and Android apps) and DrRacket (from IntroCS1)

## Setup

For the following lessons, you will need a __text editor__. While you will eventually use Android Studio for developing robot code, using a text editor is more beneficial for learning programming syntax and concepts without the superfluous features of an IDE.

While I recommend [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html), you may use any text editor you are comfortable with using, including vim, gedit, or... notepad.... Check out the [Emacs course](../emacs) if you would like to learn more about the Emacs text editor.

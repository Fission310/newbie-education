# Operators

Variables are kind of useless if we can't do anything with them. Enter operators!!!

## Examples
Guess the results. Then, copy these lines of code into your main method, compile, and run.

```java
int stuyfission = 200 + 110;
System.out.println(stuyfission);
```

```java
double stuyfusion = 3353 / 7;
System.out.println(stuyfusion);
```

```java
String iconic = "Colon" + "ardo";
System.out.println(iconic);
```

```java
System.out.println(3 < 5);
```

```java
System.out.println(3 == 5);
```

Did you get what you expected?

## Table of Operators

| Operator | Type       | Function                 | Example        |
|----------|------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| =        | assignment | assignment               | `int x = 9`    |
| +        | arithmetic | add                      | `3 + 4`        |
| -        | arithmetic | subtract                 | `9 - 6`        |
| *        | arithmetic | multiply                 | `3 * 5`        |
| /        | arithmetic | divide                   | `4 / 2`        |
| %        | arithmetic | modulus                  | `5 % 3`        |
| ++       | arithmetic | increment (by 1)         | `x++`          |
| --       | arithmetic | decrement (by 1)         | `x--`          |
| <        | comparison | less than                | `3 < 4`        |
| >        | comparison | greater than             | `8 > 9`        |
| <=       | comparison | less than or equal to    | `x <= 4`       |
| >=       | comparison | greater than or equal to | `y >= 9`       |
| ==       | comparison | equal to                 | `x == y`       |
| !=       | comparison | not equal to             | `x != y`       |
| &&       | logical    | logical AND              | `true && true` |
|          | logical    | logical OR               | `true  false`  |
| !        | logical    | logical NOT              | `!false`       |

__Note that the equal to operator IS NOT THE SAME as the assignment operator.__ One is used for comparisons, while the other is used for assigning values to variables.

## Exercises

1. Print the output of `35034 % 7`.
2. Make five booleans and set them to either true or false. What is the result of `var1 && var2 || var3 || var4 && !var5`?
3. Fill in the missing data type. `___ x = (3 == 5);`
4. Make an int and give it a value. Decrement it 3 times. Make a double with the same initial value and decrement it 3 times. Do you see a difference?
5. Make two Strings that, when added together, prints out as `OpErations`.

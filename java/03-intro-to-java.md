# Introduction to Java

## What is Java?

As mentioned in the previous lesson, Java is a __programming language__ that we can use to send instructions to our computers. Like all programming languages, it has a __syntax__ that we need to follow, and its programs need to be __compiled__ before __execution__.

## Installing Java

Chances are, you already have Java on the machine you're using to view this. If you do not, you can install Java [here](https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml).

### JDK

However, you'll also need the Java Development Kit (JDK) to be able to compile your own Java files. At the time of writing, the latest version of the JDK is 9.0.4, but you should find the latest version of the JDK and install it. You can find a link to the JDK download [here](https://java.com/en/download/faq/develop.xml).

### Git Bash

If you are on Windows, you will need to configure your computer to be able to use Git Bash to work with java files.

In Git Bash,

```
C:\> set path=%path%;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_51\bin
```
replacing `1.8.0_51` with the version of the JDK that you installed.

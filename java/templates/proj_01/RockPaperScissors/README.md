Create a program that simulates a rock paper scissors game
## Easy
* Check if the user played a valid move (Rock/Paper/Scissors)
* Check if the user won or lost the game.
## Medium
* Complete all easy challenges.
* Allow the user to choose between battling the computer or against another user (multiplayer).
* Modify the program to implement a "best of three" game.
* Allow user to replay game.
## Hard
* Complete all medium challenges.
* Instead of randomly generating a number, create a strategy to generate a move. There are many different strategies, so get creative! (e.g., Generates a move based on the frequencies of the user's past moves.)
* Create programs that use different strategies and make them battle it out to see which strategy is the best...
## Extra
There are so many different styles of rock-paper-scissors across the world. Research one of these different variations and program it, and make sure to let me know beforehand!

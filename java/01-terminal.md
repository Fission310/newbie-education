# Terminal

## What is the Terminal?

The terminal is an __application__ (a program or set of programs that serve a purpose) on a computer that allows you to type and execute commands. There's a variety of actions that these commands can perform, including:

- Accessing files and directories (folders)
- Compiling and executing code

### Command Line Interface

The terminal is an example of a Command Line Interface, or CLI. In a CLI, users interact with a computer by typing a command _in the form of text_. This means that you only need a keyboard and a screen to interact with a CLI, and most operating systems have similar commands for the same tasks.

However, in order to use a CLI, you need to know the commands themselves. Practice and experience will make you better at using a CLI.

### Graphical User Interface

The other type of user-computer interaction is done through a Graphical User Interface, or GUI. In a GUI, users interact with a computer by pressing buttons with images. GUIs tend to be more visually appealing and easier to operate, but are less efficient than CLIs because they require more resources (such as images) to run. If you're using a web browser to view this right now, you're using a GUI.

## Using the Terminal

On Ubuntu, you can open the terminal using the keyboard shortcut `CTRL-ALT-T`. On other operating systems, you can search up how to open a terminal or [click here](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+open+terminal) for help.

Note: If you are using Windows, you can install [Git Bash](http://www.techoism.com/how-to-install-git-bash-on-windows/), which can be used as a terminal on Windows.

### Terminal Commands

Here are some basic terminal commands:

| Command | Action                              | Example           |
|---------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `ls`    | list files in the current directory |                   |
| `cd`    | change the current directory        | `cd Documents`    |
| `cd ..` | goes up a directory                 |                   |
| `mkdir` | create a directory                  | `mkdir newFolder` |
| `rm`    | remove a file                       | `rm trash.txt`    |

## Why the Terminal

Performing an action using a GUI is usually much slower than typing a command on a CLI. After all, with a GUI, you have to load a window and click buttons on your screen. If you still don't believe me, try making a lot of files and deleting them. You'll find that typing out `touch` and `rm` is much faster than anything you can do on a GUI.

Also, you'll be using the terminal a lot to work with GitHub and in your APCS and beyond classes, so it's a good idea to pick it up now!

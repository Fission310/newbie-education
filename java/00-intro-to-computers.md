# Introduction to Computers

## What is a Computer?

A computer is an electronic device that stores and processes data. They accomplish this by using a combination of __hardware__ (physical parts that make up the computer) and __software__ (programs that run on the computer). Every intruction that is carried out by a computer is translated into [binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary\_number), including programs written in a variety of programming lanugages.

## Hardware vs. Software

Hardware is the physical aspect of the computer, and includes the motherboard, RAM, CPU, and peripherals such as a mouse and keyboard. Think of it as the "body" of the computer.

Software, on the other hand, makes the hardware useful. They're a set of instructions that you interact with when using a machine, and give a computer functionality. Think of it as the "brain" of the computer.

## Programming Languages

A programming language is a set of rules that can be followed to instruct a computer to perform an action. There are many different programming languages, with different __syntaxes__ (set of rules), that can perform a variety of tasks. Some examples include Java, C, and Python. The combined instructions we give a computer is called a __program__.

## How is Code Translated into Software?

By themselves, computers cannot read the code that we write in our various programming languages. That code has to be translated into binary, the language of computers, in order for the machine to be able to interpret it. This translation is called __compiling__. After a program has been compiled, it can be run, or __executed__ on the computer.
